					<h3>My Advice to Teachers: Get Out of Your Classrooms</h3>
					<img src="jilliangierke/images/zionbackbend.JPG" alt="">
					<p>In my five years of experience teaching high school students Spanish, I focused very closely on bringing relevant information into the classroom and making sure that my students were coming away with valuable, relevant skills. In a graduate-level education course, I remember reading about Jane Addams, who argued that schools are becoming isolated from the realities and issues of a changing society -- and that was more than 100 years ago. I have spent the last two years away from the classroom immersed in the realities and issues of our society, enriching my understanding of what society demands of our students once they graduate. I came away with a richer understanding of something a colleague often said  — technology in the classroom should be like oxygen; invisible yet necessary.</p>
					<p>One area I have pursued in the last two years is web design and development, where jobs go unfilled due to a deficit of folks with the required skill set. In learning JavaScript, I realized that the algebra I learned in high school was just simple JavaScript code stuck on paper. So, why aren’t students using JavaScript to build cool web applications for homework in math class instead of showing their work on college-ruled paper? In learning PHP, an essential covers-all back-end programming language, I realized that logic must have more of a presence in our students’ education (or at least it should have been more present in mine.) Even with CSS — an extremely straight-forward, simple front-end language — I found myself once again wishing I had cared more about geometry.</p>
					<p>My math teachers likely remember me as the student who asked the following charming questions in class: “So, why does this matter?” and “How does this apply to anything real?” and “When am I ever going to need to know this?” As it turns out, there are relevant applications to what we’re doing in high school math and it’s building websites.  Why don’t we merge these concepts under one umbrella and finally allow our students to see their two-dimensional algebraic functions on college-ruled paper come to life in their web browser coding with JavaScript?</p>
					<p>In addition to programming languages, I also explored the concept of identity and branding through social media promotion for a new restaurant. I was in charge of taking pictures of our food, daily specials, new cocktails and documenting what was happening at the restaurant to post on social media. I used Facebook analytics to track which posts were most successful in how many friends it reached, how many friends liked the post and how many interacted with it by sharing the post on their own timelines or commenting on the post. In manager meetings, we used this data to make decisions on the kind of content and at what time of day we would post in the following weeks.</p>
					<p>I tend to index my experiences as UBD unit plan files.  My memories of this social media project look like an English and Stats interdisciplinary project. When our students are exploring essential questions like “Who am I?” and “How do I interact with the world?”, why not provide the opportunity to have students start blogs on topics they are passionate about and use Google Analytics to generate data on their audience? Or to create a brand on social media? In this day and age, job applicants must demonstrate a successful online presence with social media, a blog and/or a portfolio of both digital and non-digital work. It is our responsibility as educators to prepare our students with that skill set.</p>
					<p>We are past the point of asking the question of how to integrate technology into the curriculum. What we are able to create with technology provides us with real applications to what we’re learning in school. We have always known that taking school seriously is important yet our students understandably question the relevancy of what they’re learning. It’s time to ease our students’ minds and provide them with the opportunities to build websites by applying the principles of algebra and geometry and then provide the continuity of learning by tracking the effectiveness of their website using Google Analytics to better understand their audience. This stuff is as real as it gets and our students deserve that.</p>
